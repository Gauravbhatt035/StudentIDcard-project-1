# StudentIDcard-project-1
Developed a dynamic Student ID card application where users input personal details (e.g., school name, student name, roll number, section, date of birth) into a form. The form data is used to generate a printable Student ID card. Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with DOM manipulation.
